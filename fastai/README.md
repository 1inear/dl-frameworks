# Fastai Intro

This is an intro to [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai). Relatively unknown in comparison to Keras, the Fastai library is a high-level set of functions built on top of PyTorch. They provide a great MOOC that provides a set of Jupyter notebooks to train high performing neural nets on a vast array of data types. This course is highly recommend as an intro to build some very applicable deep learning models. 

### GPU usage

As there is easy integration with Google Colaboratory's free GPUs we can use this notebook both in Docker but probably more efficiently in Colab. To run this notebook in Colab, navigate to open a new notebook, click on the Github tab, search for `natelangholz`, find this repository (`dl-frameworks`), and open the `fastaimnist.ipynb` notebook.
